# Chapter III - The Cove

The machines.

Dora had never been a Luddite; quite the contrary. She embraced AI, vlogging 10-20 hours a week (a clunky satire on Tamagochis) the second it became free of charge (never mind the incessant product placement) but something was off. Round about 2026, the happy chappy chirpiness exuded by all those who contacted it, whether their bank accounts were glutted with too many zeroes or just poor punters, the witless adoption bothered her like an itchy rash. 

Sure it was mind-bogglingly fast, sure it was convenient, of course the wife bots were a hit with the incels and good riddance to them all, sure it cut through the bloated vapidity the internet had become. Yet...

The hallucinations the AI bots regurgitated were certainly real (pun intended), largely due to the fact that the robots had no inkling, no vestige of reality, no proprioception, no feedback loop into reality. The human could think it could handle a hot pan, yet the pain felt would indicate that he was wrong and had to adjust its assumptions. The automaton would have to glean that feedback from wallows of junk on the internet; fact indistinguishable from myth or Marvel. 

Of course, the AI-missionaries would account for every vagary or glitch with an addition to the convoluted rule books and principles to govern the automatons. After seventy-odd years these were entirely indistinguishable from the nimble three rules of Asimov. 

Fresh out of her literature M.A. she was assigned a semi-permanent work order in the dept. Of A, D, C & F for her (feigned) assiduousness, where the irony of the kinship the bulking AI rule-books had with the Byzantine law and bylaw-books of the dept: inscrutable and obfuscating, found a receptive customer in her.

The copse was slightly elevated due to its whilom purpose as an iron-age fortification. Built on the upturned hulls of expended riverine craft, flotsam and jetsam, animal bones and discarded shards of pottery, it was essentially a raft, or, for the optimistic, a house on poles. Yet sheltering an information-age trove. 
When Dora was about done in with plodding through the sludge she stubbed her toe on one of these bones - and set off the silent alarm. The copse was overgrown with brambles, hawthorns, and stunted willows. A small opening looked like a path to something dry to her, and she crouched down and crawled in. Then strong hard hands pulled her down, and she tumbled down slippery plastic into a dimly lit cove. Of sorts.

“Who the hell are you and how did you survive THAT,” barked a gruff but young voice attached to a skinny young man with a scraggy beard and blonde wispy hair covering what looked like bright blue eyes. On saying “that,” he waved his gangly arm in a broad arc like a crooked windmill. After sliding down, Dora was sat on her butt in a plastic dome that was rather a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell.

 “Look dude, I just got here, and got lucky, so give me a break!” She snapped, “and for that matter, what the heck are YOU doing here?!” 
 
Only then she noticed the trio of people crouching a few meters back in the gloom of what looked like a corridor. Scared these might be partisaners or rebels or incels, or the unvaccinated, the unpassed, and most likely hungry and violent, she made an appeasing gesture with her hands. 

“Look, it was a mess, I don’t know what happened. I knocked my head. But the lights went wild in the SubT and then we got like a power surge and then the whole thing shot out of the Halfwegtunnel and derailed and everyone was dead or dying except me,” she explained hurriedly. 

“So I know as much as you do, okay. Oh yeah, my visapass I tossed into the fire, so I'm nobody now. By the way, my name’s Dora, and you…?" she extended her right hand. 

The dude looked relieved, smiled a skewed smile and extended his right hand and said, "My name is Tako, welcome to the Houtrakkers, this partisaner Houtrakkers Hole, Dora."
